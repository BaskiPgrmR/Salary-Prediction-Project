Final Report: Salary Prediction Project

1. Introduction
The purpose of this project is to predict the expected salary (CTC) of candidates using historical employee data. 
The dataset includes candidate profiles such as education, experience, designation, and department. The target 
variable is Expected_CTC.

2. Data Preprocessing
- Missing values were handled as follows:
  • Numeric columns: replaced with the median.
  • Categorical columns: replaced with the mode.
- One-hot encoding was applied to categorical columns to make them suitable for machine learning models.

3. Correlation Analysis
- The strongest positive correlation was observed between Expected CTC and Current CTC (0.99).
- Other positive correlations included:
  • Total Experience (0.72)
  • Field Experience (0.68)
- Negative correlations were observed with:
  • Graduation Year (-0.68)
  • PhD Year (-0.63)

4. Model Performance
The dataset was modeled using Linear Regression and XGBoost. The results are as follows:

Model                R²       MSE             MAE
------------------------------------------------------------
Linear Regression    0.9960   5.379e+09       50,421
XGBoost              0.9989   1.486e+09       24,302

XGBoost significantly outperformed Linear Regression in all performance metrics.

5. Visualizations
- Correlation Heatmap: demonstrated the strong relationship between Expected CTC and Current CTC.
- Salary Distribution: showed a right-skewed distribution, with most candidates falling in lower salary bands.
- Department-wise Salary Distribution: revealed that certain departments have higher salary expectations.
- Education Level Salary Boxplot: indicated that higher education levels are associated with higher median salaries.

6. Conclusion
The goal and objective of this project were to build a robust model that determines the salary to be offered 
to an employee, reducing reliance on manual judgment and eliminating discrimination among employees with 
similar profiles. Based on the results, XGBoost was identified as the most accurate model. This model can 
be effectively used by HR teams for fair salary benchmarking, ensuring consistency and transparency in the 
salary determination process.
